# turbowarp-self-host
An attempt to self host a turbowarp editor/ port to html files
I changed some stuff a tab bit btw.
Why did i make this? I made this because turbowarp and scratch are blocked on my schools network and i love to use turbowarp but sadly I could not find the source code to the website
and I did this so i can make it run offline like eç¾Šicques by sheeptester 
# TODO
-fix build in sprites
-port to HTML file so it can be ran locally 
-fix non-local extensions import (404?)
