# turbowarp-self-host
An attempt to self host a turbowarp editor/ port to html files \
I changed some stuff a tad bit btw. \
Why did i make this? I made this because turbowarp and scratch are blocked on my schools network and i love to use turbowarp but sadly I could not find the source code to the website
and I did this so i can make it run offline like eç¾Šicques by sheeptester \
Also it is not 100% full-prof some features do not work
# TODO
-fix build in sprites \
-fix non-local extensions import (404?) \

# Offline mode
-Check out the relases for zip file containg a version of turbowarp that can \
be somewhat ran locally, a lot of assets are loaded from jsdeliver cdn but mostly works overall \
no it was not easy to make and is not the most resent version of turbowarp
